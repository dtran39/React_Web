I. Why react:
  - Real time update of DOM (no need to refresh page)
II. Component: A part of the website
  - Needs to return some HTML
    + through a function call render
      render is going to return html
  - Every component can only return one root element
    Get around: just wrap all elements in a div
III. Props:
  - Allow you to customize your component
IV. State:
  - State vs Props: State can change
    Use when you have a value that will be changed
